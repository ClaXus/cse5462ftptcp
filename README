CSE 5462 Homework 2 Question 1
Dan Ziemba

Simple file transfer client and server using fake tcp sockets that actually
connect to tcpd, a program which wraps udp packet with a tcp header then sends
packets through the troll program to simulate poor quality networks. Currently
no checking is done for lost or corrupted packets and none of the tcp emulation
is actually done.  Speed is limited to 20 KB/s to prevent dropped packets by
troll.

Build:
Run make

Run:
Both server and client will automatically spawn tcpd and troll as needed.
	Server:
	./ftps <port>

	Client:
	./ftpc <server-host> <server-port> <file-name>
